### Warnings:
- The `User Authentication and Registration APIs` are maintained only in Abletive main site, due to security and privacy reasons
the code is written in the vendor files by Cali and is **NOT INCLUDED** in this repo. 
You can tinker around by manually creating `User` model via `php artisan tinker`
Or, simply change the code a bit. Have fun playing around :)

### Contributions:

I'd be happy if you want to contribute your ideas or code, if you're not familiar with Laravel just yet, go check the [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs)(It's pretty neat)
